== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Omnibus directive and how to configure this plugin to be compliant with? =

European Commission Directive 98/6/EC Article 6a - in short Omnibus directive - specifies price reduction announcement policy.

You don't have to do anything special, the default settings are compliant with Omnibus directive!

However, in case you misconfigured the plugin, here are steps to take to make it compliant again (please note similar suggestions hints you will see on Settings screen):

1. Go to `WooCommerce` > `Price History` screen
2. Set `Display on` to `Single product page`
3. Set `Display minimal price` to `Only when product is on sale`
4. Set `Count minimal price from` to `Day before product went on sale`
5. Set `Number of days to use when counting minimal price:` to `30 days`
6. For each product being on sale, go to its edit screen and set `Sale price dates from` to the date when the product went on sale.

= Is plugin working well with variable products? =

Yes, the plugin is compatible with product taxes and variable products (it tracks minimal price for each variation individually).

= Is plugin working well with discount addons? =

That depends on the addon. Some addons may not work with the plugin, some may work. For time being we recommend using the plugin with the following addon:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-discount-rules/

This one was confirmed to work well with the plugin. If you know of other addons which work with the plugin, please let me know on the forum! I will add it to the list.

= Is there any shortcode I could use to display minimal price? =

If you want to display the lowest products price in other place than default, you can use shortcode `wc_price_history`. A few examples:

Display the lowest price on single product page (without passing product ID as argument), currency symbol attached:
```
This product low is [wc_price_history]
```

Display the lowest price of the other product, currency symbol attached:
```
The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3]
```

Display without currency symbol:
```
The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3 show_currency=0]
```
= What filters and actions I can use to affect WC Price History internal logic? =

Available filters are:
`wc_price_history_is_correct_place` (defined in `PriorPrice\Prices::is_correct_place`)
Allows to display price history on custom screens, not listed in plugins settings. Return true to make price history visible.

`wc_price_history_is_not_correct_when` (defined in `PriorPrice\Prices::is_not_correct_when`)
Allows to stop displaying price history for your own custom conditions. Return true to prevent displaying price history.

= For some products being on sale, plugin shows minimal price from current day, why? =

This is because you have not set `Sale price dates from` for these products. Go to the product edit screen and set `Sale price dates from` to the date when the product went on sale.

Tip: All the products which are On sale but does not have `Sale price dates from` set will be logged to WooCommerce logs. Go to `WooCommerce` > `Status` > `Logs` to see the list of products (in right top corner preselect log which name starts with wc-price-history).

= Can I adjust minimal price before being it displayed? =

Yes, you can use filter `wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed`:

```
add_filter( 'wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed', function( $price, $wc_product ) {
	// do something with $price
	return $price;
}, 10, 2 );
```

= Can I clean the history? =

Yes, on the plugin configuration screen click the button 'Clean history'. This will remove all the history storage for all products. Make sure you know what you are doing (in general, use this option only if you are going to remove plugin completely).

= I have a problem with the plugin, or I want to suggest a feature. Where can do this? =

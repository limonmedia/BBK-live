Display regular and discount price in the Cart

== Description ==

By default in the WooCommerce Cart page is only displayed the discount price, using "WooCommerce Discount and regular price plugin" is displayed also the regular sale price, so your customer remember easily the discount amount.
At the end of the cart and of the checkout page diplays the total amount of money you saved with discounted price.
